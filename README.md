Optimized for screen size 80x30 or higher.

Installation:
1. get r00t\jailbreak
2. install libpcap
 Android: botbrew->libpcap, ncurses
 IOS: Cydia->libpcap
3. install terminal
 Android: Android Terminal Emulator, Terminal IDE + Hackers Keyboard
 IOS: iSSH
4. chmod +x intercepter
5. run ./intercepter without args for GUI mode or ./intercepter -h for console mode
 

### Android known issues ###

1. You may get Bad mode for the chmod command, in that case change "+x" to "777" - chmod 777 intercepter.
2. You may get Permission Denined if you run intercepter from SD card. Copy it to the internal memory.
3. Copy intercepter to /botbrew/bin in case it doesn't run.

### Encodings ###
If you need to change the encoding for the output text (when you see wrong characters in sniffed messages)
just run intercepter like that: #LC_ALL=ru_RU.koi8-r ./intercepter

To do this trick on IOS you have to download native MAC locales (http://sniff.su/mac_locale.tar.gz) and extract them
to /usr/share/locale. It is also might be needed to play with iSSH encodings and the locale values.
For russian language set iSSH encoding to UTF-8 and the LC_ALL to ru_RU.KOI8-R.

Android locales not tested yet.

### Windows build ###

ARP Poison disabled on Windows, because Console Edition doesn't have own routing ability.
